# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** November 21, 2025

## Introduction

Easy Link Collector ("we", "our", or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and handle data when you use our browser extension.

## Data Collection

### What Data We Collect

Easy Link Collector collects the following data:

- **Link URLs**: When you click on link elements on web pages while using the extension's collection mode, we collect the URLs of those links. This is the only data we collect.

### What Data We Do NOT Collect

We do NOT collect any of the following:

- Personally identifiable information (name, address, email, age, etc.)
- Health information
- Financial or payment information
- Authentication credentials (passwords, PINs, etc.)
- Personal communications (emails, messages, etc.)
- Location information (GPS, IP address, etc.)
- Web browsing history (we do not track which pages you visit)
- User activity data (clicks, mouse movements, keystrokes, etc.) beyond the link URLs you explicitly collect
- Any other personal or sensitive information

## How We Use Your Data

The collected link URLs are used solely for the following purposes:

1. **Display in Side Panel**: To show the collected links in the extension's side panel interface
2. **Editing**: To allow you to edit the collected URLs
3. **Export**: To enable export functionality (clipboard copy, CSV, or JSON format)

## Data Storage

- Collected link URLs are stored temporarily in the extension's memory (in the side panel)
- **Data is NOT stored on external servers**
- **Data is NOT stored persistently on your device** - when you close the side panel, all collected data is discarded
- If you use the export feature, the data is saved only to your local device (clipboard, CSV file, or JSON file) at your discretion

## Data Sharing and Transfer

- **We do NOT sell, rent, or share your data with third parties**
- **We do NOT transfer your data to external servers**
- **We do NOT use your data for any purpose other than the extension's core functionality** (link collection, management, and export)
- **We do NOT use your data for credit assessment or lending purposes**

All data processing occurs locally on your device.

## Data Security

Since all data is processed locally on your device and is not transmitted to external servers, the security of your data depends on your device's security. We recommend keeping your browser and operating system up to date.

## User Rights

You have full control over your data:

- **Delete Individual Links**: Click the `×` button next to any link in the side panel to remove it
- **Delete All Links**: Click the trash icon to clear all collected links
- **Automatic Deletion**: All data is automatically discarded when you close the side panel

## Third-Party Services

This extension does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. All functionality is self-contained within the extension package.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
