## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS)
- Write clear and descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task

### Commit Messages

Write clear and concise commit messages:

- Use the imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Provide additional details in the body if necessary

### Testing

Before submitting a pull request:

- Test the extension in Chrome, Edge, or another Chromium-based browser
- Verify that all existing features still work
- Test edge cases (e.g., very long URLs, pages with many links, etc.)
